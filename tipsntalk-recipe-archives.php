    <h3 class="recipe-header">Coconut Orange Cupcakes</h3>
    <p>I made these beautiful cupcakes in Wilton pink blossom cups, and you can use the Wilton scallop scissors to make the flower decoration. It looks spectacular for Shavuos, and is really easy to do! This recipe stays very fresh at room temperature for a couple of days.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 1/3 cups flour</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup coconut</li>
<li>2 teaspoons orange zest</li>
<li>1 stick margarine, softened</li>
<li>6 ounces Tofutti cream cheese</li>
<li>4 extra large eggs</li>
<li>1 ½ cups sugar</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Glaze</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup icing sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons orange juice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Decoration</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 Wilton Sugar Sheets</li>
</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Lay out 24 blossom cups on cookie sheets./li>
<li><strong>Make the Cupcakes:</strong><br>
Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, coconut and orange zest. Beat the margarine and tofutti cream cheese in an electric mixer until smooth. Add the sugar and mix until fluffy. With the mixer running, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. With the mixer running at low speed, add the flour mixture slowly. Scrape well.Divide the batter between the 24 blossom cups. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool completely.</li>
<li><strong>Decorate the Cake:</strong><br>
In a small bowl, whisk the icing sugar with the orange juice until smooth. Spread on top of the cupcakes. (If the icing is too thick, add some more orange juice).<br>
Cut 5/8 wide strips along the length of each sugar sheet. Use the scallop border insert to cut a scalloped edge on each strip.</li>
<li>Position the strips on the iced cupcakes in a spiral shape, attaching the end of the strips together with a little icing. (You will need two strips per cupcake).</li>
<li>Press gently into the icing to secure.</li>
</ol>

      <small style="display:block; padding-top:10px;">A note about all the recipes: I find that proofing the yeast yields much
better results, than just mixing it in with the dry ingredients. To proof your
yeast: In a small bowl, or in your measuring cup, mix warm water with the
sugar, sprinkle the yeast on top, cover, and let stand for 5 minutes. Then
mix, and let stand for another 5 minutes.</small></p>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Spelt Bread</h3>
    <p>I eat this bread for breakfast almost every day. It is very satisfying, and even this small loaf lasts me a few days and it freezes very well.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>150 ml very warm water </li>
<li>2 ¼ teaspoon demerara sugar </li>
<li>¾ teaspoon instant yeast <small>(I prefer the Instaferm brand)</small></li>
<li>250 grams spelt flour, about half whole spelt and half light spelt. <small>(This is approximately 1 ¾ Cups, but weighing makes more sense, as not all flours are equal in weight.)</small></li>
<li>¾ teaspoon dough enhancer <small>(This is an Israeli product, and if you can’t get your hand on it, use ¼ teaspoon gluten.)</small></li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 teaspoons oil</li>
<li>Challah topping</li>

</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Proof the yeast as per instructions above. </li>
<li>Place the flour in the small Lekue bread maker. Add the salt and dough enhancer/gluten. Mix together.</li>
<li>Put the oil into the yeast water mixture, and then pour into the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Mix together, and then knead by hand in the breadmaker, just until dough feels combined and soft.</li>
<li>Shape into log and sprinkle with challah topping.</li>
<li>Close bread maker, and place in a warm place to rise for an hour.</li>
<li>Dip into water, and then sesame seeds.</li>
<li>Place into baguette pans, and let rise again until doubled. </li>
<li>Make two diagonal cuts along top of each roll.</li>
<li>Bake at 375&deg; for about 35 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Spelt dough is sensitive, and doesn’t like to be handled too much! Do not try to punch down the dough, or egg it when risen – it just won’t go back up again! Don’t open the bread maker either – just put gently into the oven!</p>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Caraway Rye Bread</h3>
    <p>This bread was served as rolls at a school dinner many years ago that was catered by the home economics class. I wish I knew who the teacher was, so that I could thank her for this recipe!</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup hot water</li>
<li>A pinch of sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon yeast</li>
<li>1 ½ cups rye flour</li>
<li>2 cups white flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons wheat germ</li>
<li>2 tablespoons oat bran</li>
<li>½ tablespoon Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 ½ tablespoons caraway seeds, plus more for sprinkling</li>
<li>1/3 cup equal parts oil and honey</li>
<li>1 egg, beaten</li>

</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Proof the yeast as per instructions above, using the water and pinch of sugar and yeast.</li>
<li>Place all the dry ingredients in the large Lekue Bread Maker and mix well.</li>
<li>Pour the yeast mixture, oil and honey and egg into the flour mixture. <small>(You can leave over a bit of the egg for the top of the bread.)</small></li>
<li>Mix by hand, and knead well.</li>
<li>Form log, and then close bread maker.</li>
<li>Let rise in warm place until double – about 60 to 90 minutes.</li>
<li>Open the bread maker and egg the top with the left over egg mixed with water. Sprinkle with caraway seeds.</li>
<li>Place into baguette pans, and let rise again until doubled. </li>
<li>Make two diagonal cuts along top of each roll.</li>
<li>Bake at 375&deg; for about 40 minutes, until very brown.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I bake this open, because this dough just needs a little more ‘elbow room.’ The round shape looks good for this kind of bread!</p>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Mini Sesame Baguettes</h3>
    <p>These easy-to-make, airy, sesame baguettes originated as a family favourite sesame roll. I used ¼ of this recipe for one of the Leku&eacute; baguette makers. You may need a mixer if you do the full recipe, but not for the smaller amount. If you are doing the smaller amount, just leave out the egg, and put a bit more oil.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 ½ cups warm water </li>
<li>½ cup sugar </li>
<li>2 tablespoons yeast</li>
<li>1 kg all purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li> ½ cup oil</li>

</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Proof the yeast as per instructions above. </li>
<li>Mix dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Add the water/yeast mixture, oil and egg.</li>
<li>Knead until you have a soft, smooth dough.</li>
<li>Place in a warm place, and let rise until double.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into 4 parts. Roll out each part into a rectangle, a little smaller than the length of the baguette pan, and roll up lengthwise.</li>
<li>Dip into water, and then sesame seeds.</li>
<li>Place into baguette pans, and let rise again until doubled. </li>
<li>Make two diagonal cuts along top of each roll.</li>
<li>Bake at 350&deg; for 20-30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The baguette pan can be put straight on the oven rack, but you may want to put something under it, so you don&rsquo;t have sesame seeds all over the bottom of the oven. I know that from experience!</p>

    <h3 class="recipe-header"><span class="section-heading">Healthy Zoku Pop Maker Fun with Chana Rechel (Steinmetz) Jacobson</span></h3>
  
<p>Two summers ago, my mother came to visit me, just before the birth of my youngest son, and brought me something called a Zoku Pop Maker from her store, a very cool tool for creating frozen pops in nine minutes. It is the best present I ever got. Since then, as soon as summer season begins (in Israel immediately after Pesach), we take out our Zoku “machine”, and I make fresh, nutritious popsicles for the kids every day for when they come home from school. One of my kids complains that her friends come just for the popsicles! When the school season starts again, it goes away until next summer, to keep things exciting. My mother asked me to share some of my favorite recipes, tricks and tips, so here you go!</p>


<p>My son is allergic to dairy, so my popsicles are all pareve (and that way I can serve them as dessert for Shabbos lunch, too). I try very hard to keep my during-the-week popsicles sugar free, so I can give them out freely without guilt! My sweetener of choice is dried date purée. I prefer this over honey, agave nectar, fruit concentrate or silan (date syrup) (and of course over artificial sweeteners), because it actually contains the entire fruit , not just concentrated sugar. When puréed adequately it is very smooth, and when mixed into foods, it has no aftertaste at all and has a very pleasant, neutral taste. You can make your own by processing 1 pound/500 grams of dried dates (make sure to remove pits and check for infestation by holding both sides to a strong light source) with a half cup of water until utterly smooth, either in a food processor or with an immersion blender (a bit messier). You can use cup for cup as you would sugar. Using date purée will give your fruit pops a sorbet-like consistency and add creaminess to ice-cream-style pops.</p>

<h4>Pineapple Popsicles</h4>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>
1 1/3 cups natural pineapple juice (I use the juice I drain from the can when I make waldorf salad!)</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Place ingredients in a measuring cup (Chef'n Sleekstor Beaker works best for pouring into machine).</li>
<li> Add water, if necessary, until you reach the 1 ½ cup line. </li>
<li>Mix, and pour into Zoku Maker in two batches.</li>
<li>Enjoy! Makes 6 pops.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Creamy Peach Pops</h4>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>
<li>1 ¼ cups of peeled, sliced or cubed peaches, yellow or white</li>
<li>2 tablespoons date pur&eacute;e* (or orange juice concentrate, for a more citrusy flavor)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon raw, white almond butter – can omit, but pops won’t be as creamy</li>
<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, if peaches are very sweet or to taste</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Place ingredients in a measuring cup (Chef'n Sleekstor Beaker works best for pouring into machine).</li>
<li> Add water until you reach the 1 ½ cup line. </li>
<li>Blend with immersion blender. </li>
<li>Pour into Zoku Maker in two batches.</li>
<li> Enjoy! Makes 6 pops.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Red Berry Pops</h4>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2/3 cup pitted or frozen red cherries</li>
<li>2/3 cup thawed frozen strawberries</li>
<li>2-3 tablespoons date pur&eacute;e</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Place ingredients in a measuring cup (Chef'n Sleekstor Beaker works best for pouring into machine).</li>
<li> Add water until you reach the 1 ½ cup line. </li>
<li>Blend with immersion blender. </li>
<li>Pour into Zoku Maker in two batches.</li>
<li> Enjoy! Makes 6 pops.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If you want to get a little fancier, these make a great outside layer for creamsicle-style Core Pops, where the liquid inside is siphoned off as soon as the outside freezes with a special Zoku siphon or with a straw, and then filled with a vanilla flavored mixture. (In my house, these would be for Shabbos only!)</p>
<br>
<p>Play around with any fruit or fruit juice you may have on hand. The principle is: Fill your measuring cup half to three quarters with fruit or fruit juice, add some date pur&eacute;e, some lemon if too sweet, and water to reach desired quantity. Blend, pour and freeze. Some of the things I’ve tried are kiwi, concord grape juice, apricots, nectarines, mango, and even watermelon. You play around with the proportions. Less fruit/juice with more water, date and lemon can be more economical while still maintaining a very authentic, fruity taste. Be creative and have fun!</p>
<h4>Chocolate Fudge Pops</h4>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 tablespoons raw, white almond butter (you can substitute whole almond butter or hazelnut butter for slightly nuttier but probably just as yummy results!)</li>
<li>4-5 tablespoons date pur&eacute;e</li>
<li>1 ½ tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>Pinch salt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Place ingredients in a measuring cup (Chef'n Sleekstor Beaker works best for pouring into machine).</li>
<li>Add water, until you reach the 1 ½ cup line.</li>
<li>Whisk thoroughly with a fork, or blend with immersion blender for a super smooth consistency.</li>
<li>Pour into Zoku Maker in two batches.</li>
<li>Enjoy! Makes 6 pops.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Iced Coffee Pops</h4>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 ½ tablespoons raw, white almond butter (I wouldn’t try this one with the whole nut butters, but you never know…)</li>
<li>4 tablespoons date pur&eacute;e</li>
<li>½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 teaspoons instant granulated coffee</li>
<li>Pinch salt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Place ingredients in a measuring cup (Chef'n Sleekstor Beaker works best for pouring into machine).</li>
<li>Add water, until you reach the 1 ½ cup line.</li>
<li>Whisk thoroughly with a fork, or blend with immersion blender for a super smooth consistency.</li>
<li>Pour into Zoku Maker in two batches.</li>
<li>Enjoy! Makes 6 pops.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Peanut Butter Pops</h4>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 tablespoons smooth, natural peanut butter</li>
<li>5 tablespoons date pur&eacute;e</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon vinegar</li>
<li>Pinch salt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Place ingredients in a measuring cup (Chef'n Sleekstor Beaker works best for pouring into machine).</li>
<li>Add water, until you reach the 1 ½ cup line.</li>
<li>Whisk thoroughly with a fork, or blend with immersion blender for a super smooth consistency.</li>
<li>Pour into Zoku Maker in two batches.</li>
<li>Enjoy! Makes 6 pops.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<p>You can also layer this mixture with the chocolate fudge recipe, for a striped pop, but replace almond butter with natural peanut butter. Really delicious! This is what I ate for 24 hours after I had my wisdom tooth removed!</p>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">APPLE PIE</h3>
  <p>Loads of apples in a perfect pastry.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Crust</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups flour


</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2/3 cup margarine or shortening</li>
<li>
5-7 tablespoons ice water</li>
<li>egg wash</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
    <li>*1 tin apple pie filling (or cherry pie filling)</li>
    <li>*2-3 grated apples</li>
    <li>juice of half a lemon</li>
</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>To make the crust, stir the flour and salt together. With a pastry blender, cut in the margarine or shortening until pieces are the size of small peas. Add the ice water, and toss until all the flour is moistened and mixture starts to form a ball. Divide the dough into two parts.</li>
<li>Roll out one part of the dough, and place in a 9-10 inch pie plate. Brush with a mixture made with one egg and two teaspoons water. (This prevents bottom dough from getting soggy.)</li>
<li>Combine the filling ingredients and spoon into pastry lined pan.</li>
<li>Roll out the second half of the dough. Use an apple pie topper to get the effect shown, and trim with pastry leaves.</li>
<li>Bake at 425&deg; for 45-50 minutes.</li>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">APPLE tart</h3>
  <p>By Denise Levin</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Base</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li> 1 cup flour </li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup margarine</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon sugar</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
    <li>*1 tin apple pie filling (or cherry pie filling)</li>
    <li>*2-3 grated apples</li>
    <li>juice of half a lemon</li>

</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Mix all base ingredients until crumbly and pat into a flan pan with a removable base and up the sides.</li>

<li>Combine all the filling ingredients and pour on top of crumbly base.</li>

<li>Bake at 375&deg; for 45-55 minutes. Allow to cool, then dust with icing sugar.</li>

<li>*For blueberry tart, use 1 tin of blueberry pie filling, and 2/3 cup of blueberries.</li>

<li>I made a double recipe of the dough, and used a narrow rectangle flan pan for the apple tart, and a 10 inch pan for the blueberry tart I had too much filling for the apple tart, and too little for the blueberry tart, so I made the larger pan with half blueberry and half apple filling. It was a mistake that worked out beautifully!</li>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Babby Rosie's Honey Cake</h3>
<p>My grandmother used to come to us every year with this honey cake. She baked it in a sheet pan, lined with a brown paper bag. I've kept the recipe and make it every year. I've added the bees for a special yom tov effect!</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Cake</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 whole seedless orange, cut in chunks (do not peel)</li>
<li>6 eggs</li>
<li>1 cup (+2 Tbsp) sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup oil</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups honey</li>
<li>3 cups flour</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
<li>3/4 cup strong coffee (or 1 1/2 tablespoons instant coffee dissolved in 3/4 cup boiling water)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Honey Icing</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 1/2 cups icing sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
    <li>1-3 tablespoons soymilk</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Bees</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Use ready-made (sold at Kitchen Art)</li>

</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F. Grease and flour a large bundt pan or tube pan or coat with  baking spray.</li>
<li>Place orange in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse with quick on/offs until finely minced. Set aside.</li>
<li>Using an electric mixer, beat eggs with sugar until light, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add remaining ingredients except for orange and mix until combined. Add orange to batter and mix until combined.</li>
<li>Fill the pans with batter.</li>
<li>Bake for 1 hour and 5 minutes. (When you insert a cake tester, it will come out without any batter clinging to it.)</li>
<li>Cool for 15 minutes in pan, then invert onto cooling rack, and cool completely.</li>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Mini Baked Apples</h3>
  <p>A beautiful presentation to end off your meal.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Mini Baked Apples</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">

<li>2 dozen mini apples</li>
    <li>bread crumbs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Coating</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup chopped pecans or raisins</li>
    <li>2/3 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon brandy</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Dough Leaves</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 sticks margarine</li>
    <li>7-8 tablespoons ice water</li>
    <li>soymilk</li>
    <li>cinnamon</li>
    <li>sugar crystals</li>
    <li>cinnamon sticks</li>

</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Peel and core the apples.</li>
<li>Sprinkle bread crumbs at the bottom of disposable mini brioche pans or ramekins. The apples should fit snugly, as they tend to shrink as they bake.</li>
<li>Combine the coating ingredients in a bowl; roll the apples in the coating. Place the apples in the brioche pans or ramekins.</li>
<li>Combine the filling ingredients, and place in apple cavities.</li>
<li>To make the dough, stir the flour and salt together in a medium bowl. With a pastry blender or fork, cut in the margarine until pieces are the size of small peas. Add a little of the ice water at a time, and toss with a fork until all the flour is moistened and mixture starts to form a ball. Gather dough in your hands, and gently shape into a flat ball.</li>
<li>Roll the dough out, and cut out leaves with a small leaf shaped cookie cutter. Reroll any scraps, and keep cutting until you have 72 leaves. (If you have leftover dough, you can freeze it for another time.)</li>
<li>Place three leaves on the top of each apple, pressing down slightly. Brush each leaf with soy milk, and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar crystals. Plce a piece of cinnamon stick in the center to form a stem.</li>
<li>Bake at 350&deg; for about 35-50 minutes, depending on the size of the apple. (If the dough starts to brown too quickly, cover lightly with foil for the rest of the baking time.)</li>
<li>If desired, plate with a cookie and fresh fruit.</li>

<li> 2 1/2 cups flour
</li>
<li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 sticks margarine, slightly firm</li>
<li>3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

   <h3 class="recipe-header">Classic Fried Donuts</h3>


<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Donuts</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
    <li>Generous 1/2 cup of mashed potato (about one large potato)</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups water, reserved from cooking potato</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dry yeast</li>
<li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>4 1/2 to 5 cups flour</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Chocolate Glaze</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
    <li> 2 oz. chocolate, melted</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cocoa</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
    <li>2 cups icing sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 cup hot water</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Cinnamon-Sugar Coating</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup icing sugar</li>
    <li>water</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. cinnamon
    </li>

  </ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>In a mixer, mix the sugar with the warm potato water. Sprinkle the yeast on top of this mixture, cover, and let sit for 5 minutes. Mix, and then let rest until the yeast begins to bubble.</p>

<p>Add 2 cups of the flour, the potato, the oil and the salt. Beat until a smooth paste forms. Add the rest of the flour, a half-cup at a time, to form a smooth, soft dough. Allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about one hour.</p>

<p>Roll out the dough to between 1/4 and 1/2 inch thickness. Cut out donuts with a donut cutter. Alternatively, you could use a round cookie cutter, and an apple corer for the holes. Reroll scraps, and repeat. Place on a greased surface, and let rise for 20 to 30 minutes. In a deep skillet or wok, heat 2 inches of oil to 350&deg;F, or until small bubbles form when a wooden spoon is placed in the hot oil. </p>

<p>Using a greased spatula, drop the donuts top-side down into the hot oil. Fry for about half a minute, then turn over and fry for another half a minute. Remove from pan with a slotted spatula, and place on a paper-towel-lined platter. Makes approximately 50 donuts.</p>

<h5>Chocolate Glaze:</h5>

<p>Mix all the ingredients until smooth. Dip tops of donuts into the glaze, and allow to set.</p>

<h5>Cinnamon-Sugar Coating:</h5>

<p>In one bowl, mix icing sugar with water to make a loose glaze. In another bowl, mix sugar and cinnamon. Dip tops of donuts into glaze, and then immediately into the cinnamon-sugar.</p>

   <h3 class="recipe-header">Israeli Jelly Donuts (Sufganiyot)</h3>


<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
   <li>1 cup warm water</li>
    <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dry yeast</li>
    <li>6 to 6 1/2 cups flour</li>
    <li>1 1/4 stick margarine, softened</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons brandy</li>
    <li>Grated zest of one lemon</li>
  </ul>

 

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>Combine the sugar and the water. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let sit for 5 minutes. Mix, and let sit until the yeast bubbles.</p>

<p>Add 3 cups of flour, along with the remaining ingredients, and mix well. Add the rest of the flour, half a cup at a time, and knead to form a smooth dough.</p>

<p>After all the ingredients are will mixed, knead at high speed for another 8 minutes. Turn dough into a greased bowl. Cover with a towel, and let rise until double, about an hour.</p>

<p>Form the dough into egg-sized balls and place on a greased cookie sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart. Allow to double in bulk - about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>In a deep skillet or wok, heat 2 inches of oil to 350&deg;F, or until a wooden spoon generates small bubbles when placed in the pan. With a well-greased spatula, pick up the donuts and rop top-side down into the hot oil. Fry for about 1 1/2 minutes then turn over, and fry for another minute on the other side. With a slotted spoon, remove the donuts and place on paper towels.</p>

<p>Using a pastry bag fitted with a &#35;230 tip, fill with jelly, dulce de leche, or custard. Sprinkle tops with icing sugar.</p>

<p>Makes approximately 30 donuts.</p>

<h5>Tips for Frying:</h5>

<p>Place a carrot in the pan of oil to absorb impurities.</p>

<p>If oil gets too hot, add oil from the bottle or turn off burner for a few minutes.</p>

   <h3 class="recipe-header">Chanuka Gelt Cake</h3>


<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
    <li> 1 round cake, about 4 inches high, or 2 2-inch high round layer cakes</li>
    <li>Approximately 2 cups frosting</li>
    <li>6 oz. good quality bittersweet chocolate</li>
    <li>1 chocolate transfer sheet</li>
    <li>Gold foil-covered chocolate coins</li>
    <li>Optional: 1 1/2 yards of ribbon</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>Bake and frost your cake. If you have two layers, frost in between the layers, too. It is not necessary to do a perfect job on the sides, as they will get covered. Note: To avoid getting crumbs in your frosting, freeze the cake first.</p>

<p>Cut the chocolate transfer sheet into strips, lengthwise. The width of each strip should measure the height of the cake, plus half an inch. Check to see how much you need to go around the cake, and cut off any excess. Make sure the strips meet, but do not overlap.</p>

<p>Melt the chocolate and spread generously and as evenly as possible on the transfer sheets, printed side up. Refrigerate for a few minutes to set the chocolate slightly, so that it is not runny, but is still flexible.</p>

<p>Wrap the sheets around the cake, chocolate side touching the cake. Put the straightest edge at the top of the cake.</p>

<p>Refrigerate for about 20 minutes, or until set. Carefully peel off the transfer sheets.</p>

<p>Fill in the top of the cake with the &quot;Chanuka Gelt&quot;.</p>

<p>For an added touch, tie a coordinating ribbon around the cake.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
    <li> 1 medium onion </li>
    <li>4 large potatoes (I like Yukon Gold; they don't turn brown as quickly).</li>
    <li>1 slightly beaten egg, optional</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>A few grates fresh pepper</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, plus a little for brushing pan</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F. Brush muffin-top cavities with some olive oil.</p>

<p>Grate the onion in your food processor with the smallest hole shredding attachment, or use a Microplane.</p>

<p>Grate the potatoes the same way, into the onion. (This previents the potatoes from turning brown.)</p>

<p>Set the potato/onion mixture in a colander for a few minutes, allowing liquids to drain.</p>

<p>Add the other ingredients, and mix well.</p>

<p>Spoon the mixture into the muffin-top pans or use a pancake dispenser, and flatten with a spoon.</p>

<p>Bake for 10 minutes on one side, then flip over, and bake for another 5-10 minutes.</p>

<p>You can make these latkes ahead of time, and freeze them. To reheat, place frozen latkes on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and pop, frozen, into a 400&deg;F oven for 8-10 minutes. (Note: The egg-free version is not as good frozen and reheated).</p>

<p>Makes 12 latkes.</p>

   <h3 class="recipe-header">Dairy Mushroom Turnovers</h3>


<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Dough</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
    <li>8 oz. softened whipped cream cheese</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cut into half inch cubes</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1/2 pound mushrooms, minced</li>
    <li>1 large onion, minced</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon thyme</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>Place all pastry ingredients into a bowl and, with a fork, mix and mash until dough begins to form. Do not overwork the dough. Press into a disk shape and refrigerate until ready to roll out.</p>

<p>In a 10-inch skillet, over medium heat, cook the mushrooms and onions in hot butter until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in sour cream, salt, thyme, and flour. Set aside.</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 450&deg;F. Divide the dough into two parts, and roll out each half on a well-floured surface, to a twelve by twelve inch square. Place one rolled-out half on a well-floured perogie maker. Spoon the filling into the dough lined pockets. Cover with the other half of hte dough. Press the top layer of dough, gently. Roll a rolling pin firmly over the perogie maker. Turn the perogie maker over, and tap gently on its back to release the turnovers. Reroll the scraps, and repeat process, this time covering only half the area of the perogie maker. Continue to do this until the dough is used up, covering a smaller area of the perogie maker each time.</p>

<p>Brush with slightly beaten egg.</p>

<p>Bake 12-15 minutes, or until golden.</p>

<p>You can freeze these turnovers unbaked, then pop them right in the oven - just bake a little longer.</p>

<p>Makes approximately 24 turnovers. </p>
