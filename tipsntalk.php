    <p>Two summers ago, my mother came to visit me, just before the birth of my youngest son, and brought me something called a Zoku Pop Maker from her store, a very cool tool for creating frozen pops in nine minutes. It is the best present I ever got. Since then, as soon as summer season begins (in Israel immediately after Pesach), we take out our Zoku “machine”, and I make fresh, nutritious popsicles for the kids every day for when they come home from school. One of my kids complains that her friends come just for the popsicles! When the school season starts again, it goes away until next summer, to keep things exciting. My mother asked me to share some of my favorite recipes, tricks and tips, so here you go!</p>
    
     <br>
    
    <p>My son is allergic to dairy, so my popsicles are all pareve (and that way I can serve them as dessert for Shabbos lunch, too). I try very hard to keep my during-the-week popsicles sugar free, so I can give them out freely without guilt! My sweetener of choice is dried date pur&eacute;e. I prefer this over honey, agave nectar, fruit concentrate or silan (date syrup) (and of course over artificial sweeteners), because it actually contains the entire fruit , not just concentrated sugar. When pur&eacute;ed adequately it is very smooth, and when mixed into foods, it has no aftertaste at all and has a very pleasant, neutral taste. You can make your own by processing 1 pound/500 grams of dried dates (make sure to remove pits and check for infestation by holding both sides to a strong light source) with a half cup of water until utterly smooth, either in a food processor or with an immersion blender (a bit messier).  You can use cup for cup as you would sugar. Using date pur&eacute;e will give your fruit pops a sorbet-like consistency and add creaminess to ice-cream-style pops.</p>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Pineapple Popsicles</h3>

<h4>Directions</h4>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Creamy Peach Pops</h3>
  

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 ¼ cups of peeled, sliced or cubed peaches, yellow or white</li>
<li>2 tablespoons date pur&eacute;e* (or orange juice concentrate, for a more citrusy flavor)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon raw, white almond butter – can omit, but pops won’t be as creamy</li>
<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, if peaches are very sweet or to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Place ingredients in a measuring cup (Chef'n Sleekstor Beaker works best for pouring into machine).</li>
<li> Add water until you reach the 1 ½ cup line. </li>
<li>Blend with immersion blender. </li>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Red Berry Pops</h3>
  

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2/3 cup pitted or frozen red cherries</li>
<li>2/3 cup thawed frozen strawberries</li>
<li>2-3 tablespoons date pur&eacute;e</li>
</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Place ingredients in a measuring cup (Chef'n Sleekstor Beaker works best for pouring into machine).</li>
<li> Add water until you reach the 1 ½ cup line. </li>
<li>Blend with immersion blender. </li>
<li>Pour into Zoku Maker in two batches.</li>
<li> Enjoy! Makes 6 pops.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If you want to get a little fancier, these make a great outside layer for creamsicle-style Core Pops, where the liquid inside is siphoned off as soon as the outside freezes with a special Zoku siphon or with a straw, and then filled with a vanilla flavored mixture. (In my house, these would be for Shabbos only!)</p>
<br>
<p>Play around with any fruit or fruit juice you may have on hand. The principle is: Fill your measuring cup half to three quarters with fruit or fruit juice, add some date pur&eacute;e, some lemon if too sweet, and water to reach desired quantity. Blend, pour and freeze. Some of the things I’ve tried are kiwi, concord grape juice, apricots, nectarines, mango, and even watermelon. You play around with the proportions. Less fruit/juice with more water, date and lemon can be more economical while still maintaining a very authentic, fruity taste. Be creative and have fun!</p>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Peanut Butter Pops</h3>
  

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 tablespoons smooth, natural peanut butter</li>
<li>5 tablespoons date pur&eacute;e</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon vinegar</li>
<li>Pinch salt</li>

</ol>
<br>
<p>You can also layer this mixture with the chocolate fudge recipe, for a striped pop, but replace almond butter with natural peanut butter. Really delicious! This is what I ate for 24 hours after I had my wisdom tooth removed!</p>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Coconut Orange Cupcakes</h3>
    <p>I made these beautiful cupcakes in Wilton pink blossom cups, and you can use the Wilton scallop scissors to make the flower decoration. It looks spectacular for Shavuos, and is really easy to do! This recipe stays very fresh at room temperature for a couple of days.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 1/3 cups flour</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup coconut</li>
<li>2 teaspoons orange zest</li>
<li>1 stick margarine, softened</li>
<li>6 ounces Tofutti cream cheese</li>
<li>4 extra large eggs</li>
<li>1 ½ cups sugar</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Glaze</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup icing sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons orange juice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Decoration</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 Wilton Sugar Sheets</li>
</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Lay out 24 blossom cups on cookie sheets./li>
<li><strong>Make the Cupcakes:</strong><br>
Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, coconut and orange zest. Beat the margarine and tofutti cream cheese in an electric mixer until smooth. Add the sugar and mix until fluffy. With the mixer running, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. With the mixer running at low speed, add the flour mixture slowly. Scrape well.Divide the batter between the 24 blossom cups. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool completely.</li>
<li><strong>Decorate the Cake:</strong><br>
In a small bowl, whisk the icing sugar with the orange juice until smooth. Spread on top of the cupcakes. (If the icing is too thick, add some more orange juice).<br>
Cut 5/8 wide strips along the length of each sugar sheet. Use the scallop border insert to cut a scalloped edge on each strip.</li>
<li>Position the strips on the iced cupcakes in a spiral shape, attaching the end of the strips together with a little icing. (You will need two strips per cupcake).</li>
<li>Press gently into the icing to secure.</li>
</ol>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Mini Sesame Baguettes</h3>
    <p>These easy-to-make, airy, sesame baguettes originated as a family favourite sesame roll. I used ¼ of this recipe for one of the Leku&eacute; baguette makers. You may need a mixer if you do the full recipe, but not for the smaller amount. If you are doing the smaller amount, just leave out the egg, and put a bit more oil.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 ½ cups warm water </li>
<li>½ cup sugar </li>
<li>2 tablespoons yeast</li>
<li>1 kg all purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li> ½ cup oil</li>

</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Proof the yeast as per instructions above. </li>
<li>Mix dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Add the water/yeast mixture, oil and egg.</li>
<li>Knead until you have a soft, smooth dough.</li>
<li>Place in a warm place, and let rise until double.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into 4 parts. Roll out each part into a rectangle, a little smaller than the length of the baguette pan, and roll up lengthwise.</li>
<li>Dip into water, and then sesame seeds.</li>
<li>Place into baguette pans, and let rise again until doubled. </li>
<li>Make two diagonal cuts along top of each roll.</li>
<li>Bake at 350&deg; for 20-30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The baguette pan can be put straight on the oven rack, but you may want to put something under it, so you don&rsquo;t have sesame seeds all over the bottom of the oven. I know that from experience!</p>
