<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li> 2 1/2 cups flour
</li>
<li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 sticks margarine, slightly firm</li>
<li>3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
</ul>


<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>Sift together the flour, corn starch, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

<p>Beat together the margarine and the sugar. Add the egg and vanilla just until incorporated. Add the dry ingredients, half at a time, mixing until smooth.</p>

<p>Divide the dough in half. With lightly floured hands, shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk with plastic and refrigerate for fifteen minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>

<p>On a lightly floured surface, working with one half of the dough at a time, roll the dough to between 1/8 and 1/4 inch thick. Cut out with dreidel shaped cookie cutter. Transfer to lined cookie sheets.</p>

<p>Bake the cookies for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the edges begin to brown. Let cool for two minutes; then remove to cooling rack. Allow to cool before icing.</p>

<p>Ice the cookies with Wilton Cookie Icing. Allow to dry. Use an icing writer to draw the lines and letters on each cookie, one at a time.</p>
<p>Immediately sprinkle coloured sugars on the lines and letters. Shake off any excess sugar.</p>

<p>Makes approximately 3 dozen 3-inch cookies.</p>

    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>

   <h3 class="recipe-header">Classic Fried Donuts</h3>


<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Donuts</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
    <li>Generous 1/2 cup of mashed potato (about one large potato)</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups water, reserved from cooking potato</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dry yeast</li>
<li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>4 1/2 to 5 cups flour</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Chocolate Glaze</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
    <li> 2 oz. chocolate, melted</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cocoa</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
    <li>2 cups icing sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 cup hot water</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Cinnamon-Sugar Coating</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup icing sugar</li>
    <li>water</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. cinnamon
    </li>

  </ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>In a mixer, mix the sugar with the warm potato water. Sprinkle the yeast on top of this mixture, cover, and let sit for 5 minutes. Mix, and then let rest until the yeast begins to bubble.</p>

<p>Add 2 cups of the flour, the potato, the oil and the salt. Beat until a smooth paste forms. Add the rest of the flour, a half-cup at a time, to form a smooth, soft dough. Allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about one hour.</p>

<p>Roll out the dough to between 1/4 and 1/2 inch thickness. Cut out donuts with a donut cutter. Alternatively, you could use a round cookie cutter, and an apple corer for the holes. Reroll scraps, and repeat. Place on a greased surface, and let rise for 20 to 30 minutes. In a deep skillet or wok, heat 2 inches of oil to 350&deg;F, or until small bubbles form when a wooden spoon is placed in the hot oil. </p>

<p>Using a greased spatula, drop the donuts top-side down into the hot oil. Fry for about half a minute, then turn over and fry for another half a minute. Remove from pan with a slotted spatula, and place on a paper-towel-lined platter. Makes approximately 50 donuts.</p>

<h5>Chocolate Glaze:</h5>

<p>Mix all the ingredients until smooth. Dip tops of donuts into the glaze, and allow to set.</p>

<h5>Cinnamon-Sugar Coating:</h5>

<p>In one bowl, mix icing sugar with water to make a loose glaze. In another bowl, mix sugar and cinnamon. Dip tops of donuts into glaze, and then immediately into the cinnamon-sugar.</p>

   <h3 class="recipe-header">Israeli Jelly Donuts (Sufganiyot)</h3>


<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
   <li>1 cup warm water</li>
    <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dry yeast</li>
    <li>6 to 6 1/2 cups flour</li>
    <li>1 1/4 stick margarine, softened</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons brandy</li>
    <li>Grated zest of one lemon</li>
  </ul>

 

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>Combine the sugar and the water. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let sit for 5 minutes. Mix, and let sit until the yeast bubbles.</p>

<p>Add 3 cups of flour, along with the remaining ingredients, and mix well. Add the rest of the flour, half a cup at a time, and knead to form a smooth dough.</p>

<p>After all the ingredients are will mixed, knead at high speed for another 8 minutes. Turn dough into a greased bowl. Cover with a towel, and let rise until double, about an hour.</p>

<p>Form the dough into egg-sized balls and place on a greased cookie sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart. Allow to double in bulk - about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>In a deep skillet or wok, heat 2 inches of oil to 350&deg;F, or until a wooden spoon generates small bubbles when placed in the pan. With a well-greased spatula, pick up the donuts and rop top-side down into the hot oil. Fry for about 1 1/2 minutes then turn over, and fry for another minute on the other side. With a slotted spoon, remove the donuts and place on paper towels.</p>

<p>Using a pastry bag fitted with a &#35;230 tip, fill with jelly, dulce de leche, or custard. Sprinkle tops with icing sugar.</p>

<p>Makes approximately 30 donuts.</p>

<h5>Tips for Frying:</h5>

<p>Place a carrot in the pan of oil to absorb impurities.</p>

<p>If oil gets too hot, add oil from the bottle or turn off burner for a few minutes.</p>

   <h3 class="recipe-header">Chanuka Gelt Cake</h3>


<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
    <li> 1 round cake, about 4 inches high, or 2 2-inch high round layer cakes</li>
    <li>Approximately 2 cups frosting</li>
    <li>6 oz. good quality bittersweet chocolate</li>
    <li>1 chocolate transfer sheet</li>
    <li>Gold foil-covered chocolate coins</li>
    <li>Optional: 1 1/2 yards of ribbon</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>Bake and frost your cake. If you have two layers, frost in between the layers, too. It is not necessary to do a perfect job on the sides, as they will get covered. Note: To avoid getting crumbs in your frosting, freeze the cake first.</p>

<p>Cut the chocolate transfer sheet into strips, lengthwise. The width of each strip should measure the height of the cake, plus half an inch. Check to see how much you need to go around the cake, and cut off any excess. Make sure the strips meet, but do not overlap.</p>

<p>Melt the chocolate and spread generously and as evenly as possible on the transfer sheets, printed side up. Refrigerate for a few minutes to set the chocolate slightly, so that it is not runny, but is still flexible.</p>

<p>Wrap the sheets around the cake, chocolate side touching the cake. Put the straightest edge at the top of the cake.</p>

<p>Refrigerate for about 20 minutes, or until set. Carefully peel off the transfer sheets.</p>

<p>Fill in the top of the cake with the &quot;Chanuka Gelt&quot;.</p>

<p>For an added touch, tie a coordinating ribbon around the cake.</p>

   <h3 class="recipe-header">Oven-fried Potato Latkes</h3>


<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
    <li> 1 medium onion </li>
    <li>4 large potatoes (I like Yukon Gold; they don't turn brown as quickly).</li>
    <li>1 slightly beaten egg, optional</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>A few grates fresh pepper</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, plus a little for brushing pan</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F. Brush muffin-top cavities with some olive oil.</p>

<p>Grate the onion in your food processor with the smallest hole shredding attachment, or use a Microplane.</p>

<p>Grate the potatoes the same way, into the onion. (This previents the potatoes from turning brown.)</p>

<p>Set the potato/onion mixture in a colander for a few minutes, allowing liquids to drain.</p>

<p>Add the other ingredients, and mix well.</p>

<p>Spoon the mixture into the muffin-top pans or use a pancake dispenser, and flatten with a spoon.</p>

<p>Bake for 10 minutes on one side, then flip over, and bake for another 5-10 minutes.</p>

<p>You can make these latkes ahead of time, and freeze them. To reheat, place frozen latkes on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and pop, frozen, into a 400&deg;F oven for 8-10 minutes. (Note: The egg-free version is not as good frozen and reheated).</p>

<p>Makes 12 latkes.</p>

   <h3 class="recipe-header">Dairy Mushroom Turnovers</h3>


<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Dough</strong></p>
<ul class="ingredients">
    <li>8 oz. softened whipped cream cheese</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cut into half inch cubes</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1/2 pound mushrooms, minced</li>
    <li>1 large onion, minced</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon thyme</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>Place all pastry ingredients into a bowl and, with a fork, mix and mash until dough begins to form. Do not overwork the dough. Press into a disk shape and refrigerate until ready to roll out.</p>

<p>In a 10-inch skillet, over medium heat, cook the mushrooms and onions in hot butter until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in sour cream, salt, thyme, and flour. Set aside.</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 450&deg;F. Divide the dough into two parts, and roll out each half on a well-floured surface, to a twelve by twelve inch square. Place one rolled-out half on a well-floured perogie maker. Spoon the filling into the dough lined pockets. Cover with the other half of hte dough. Press the top layer of dough, gently. Roll a rolling pin firmly over the perogie maker. Turn the perogie maker over, and tap gently on its back to release the turnovers. Reroll the scraps, and repeat process, this time covering only half the area of the perogie maker. Continue to do this until the dough is used up, covering a smaller area of the perogie maker each time.</p>

<p>Brush with slightly beaten egg.</p>

<p>Bake 12-15 minutes, or until golden.</p>

<p>You can freeze these turnovers unbaked, then pop them right in the oven - just bake a little longer.</p>

<p>Makes approximately 24 turnovers. </p>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Coconut Orange Cupcakes</h3>
    <p>I made these beautiful cupcakes in Wilton pink blossom cups, and you can use the Wilton scallop scissors to make the flower decoration. It looks spectacular for Shavuos, and is really easy to do! This recipe stays very fresh at room temperature for a couple of days.</p>

    <h3 class="recipe-header">Mini Sesame Baguettes</h3>
    <p>These easy-to-make, airy, sesame baguettes originated as a family favourite sesame roll. I used ¼ of this recipe for one of the Leku&eacute; baguette makers. You may need a mixer if you do the full recipe, but not for the smaller amount. If you are doing the smaller amount, just leave out the egg, and put a bit more oil.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 ½ cups warm water </li>
<li>½ cup sugar </li>
<li>2 tablespoons yeast</li>
<li>1 kg all purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li> ½ cup oil</li>

</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol class="ingredients">
<li>Proof the yeast as per instructions above. </li>
<li>Mix dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Add the water/yeast mixture, oil and egg.</li>
<li>Knead until you have a soft, smooth dough.</li>
<li>Place in a warm place, and let rise until double.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into 4 parts. Roll out each part into a rectangle, a little smaller than the length of the baguette pan, and roll up lengthwise.</li>
<li>Dip into water, and then sesame seeds.</li>
<li>Place into baguette pans, and let rise again until doubled. </li>
<li>Make two diagonal cuts along top of each roll.</li>
<li>Bake at 350&deg; for 20-30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The baguette pan can be put straight on the oven rack, but you may want to put something under it, so you don&rsquo;t have sesame seeds all over the bottom of the oven. I know that from experience!</p>
